## Data Mining the Impact of Wildfires on Unemployment in the U.S.

This project investigates the relationship between wildfires and unemployment rates in the U.S. from 1990-2016 using data mining and machine learning techniques.

### Completed Project Objectives
* Analyzed the relationship between wildfires and unemployment rates in the U.S. using data mining techniques. 
* Utilized Python and Pandas for extensive data preprocessing, integrating datasets on wildfire events, unemployment rates, and economic indicators. 
* Developed and evaluated multiple regression models, including linear regression and decision tree regression, to predict unemployment trends. Implemented advanced feature engineering, such as temporal data aggregation and fire size categorization, to refine predictive accuracy. 
* Findings revealed a minimal direct impact of wildfires on unemployment rates, highlighting the complexity of socioeconomic recovery and the importance of localized analysis for disaster policy planning
